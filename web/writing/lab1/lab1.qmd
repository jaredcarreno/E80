## Writing Assignment
In this writing assignment you will create a figure, write a caption for it, and write a paragraph of text to reference and explain the figure.
In doing this, you will learn how to create a well-designed figure to clearly and effectively present captured data.
You will also learn how to refer to the figure in supporting text by writing a short paragraph to explain the signficance of the data and the important takeaways.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this writing assignment you will...

- Learn how to design a clear figure
- Understand what information should be in the figure, figure caption, and text referencing the figure.

## Required Resources

- [ ] Data from Lab 1
- [ ] Code used to process and plot Lab 1 data
- [ ] Figure generated from Lab 1 

## Specifications

### Figure Design

- [ ] Y-axis label is clear and descriptive of the dependent variable
- [ ] X-axis label is clear and descriptive of the independent variable
- [ ] All axis ticks are legible
- [ ] Graph is easily readable (e.g., appropriate fonts, line weights and data markers and not overly cluttered)
- [ ] Legend is present and well-placed if multiple lines are present on the plot (e.g., no on top of any data)
- [ ] Correct units in the labels for both axes (e.g., Distance [m])
- [ ] Data is shown with good level of zoom to highlight the important parts of the captured trace. Beginning and end of the trace is trimmed.
- [ ] Data overlayed well (e.g., all three axes of acceleration measurements are plotted together on the same axes in different colors.)

### Caption

- [ ] Contains a figure number.
- [ ] Includes a succinct description of the contents of the figure.
- [ ] Is free of grammar and spelling issues.

### Supporting Text

- [ ] Refers to each figure
- [ ] Explains the significance and meaning of the figure.
- [ ] Correct sentence mechanics like cohesion and coherence between sentences and no run-ons.
- [ ] Correct paragraph mechanics like topic sentences and placement at breaks between ideas.
- [ ] Language is not stilted and jargon is kept to a reasonable minimum.

### Code

- [ ] Code used to process and plot the captured data is present.
- [ ] Each script file has a descriptive filename (e.g., `acceleration_data_procesor.m`).
- [ ] Filename, author name, author email, and date included at the top of each script file.
- [ ] Each function contains a comment at the top describing its purpose.
- [ ] Script file automatically exports and generated figures or processed data to files.
